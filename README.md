# SmartThings Light Helper

Its very common for people to put Zigbee bulbs (Cree, Philips Hue, Osram LIGHTIFY) on a z-wave switch.  An unfortunate complexity of this topography is that the connected bulb doesn't know when it's "off".

This SmartApp lets you pick a switch and a set of connected bulbs.  An on or off on the switch will update the state of the bulb, keeping your other SmartApps up to date.
